Design: The reasoning behind the color design is trying to depict a Poppy field. The green background is suppose to show the stems and leaves of the plants. The flowers are either a deep red or a burnt orange color, in the map shown by the parks and buildings. The roads are brown to represent sticks or dried twigs. Evelation is highlighted as a burnt orange showing some of the contrast of the flowers.
